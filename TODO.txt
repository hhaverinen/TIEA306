Fixes:
-Alias-window's alias dropbox's selected item wont' render name properly after update
(renders correcly after selecting other alias and then selecting the modified alias again)

Features:
-Generate sql clause that copies resultset/table/whole db?
-Multiline support (works almost?)
-Support for several sql work sheets?
-Support for several connections (tabbed or dropbox selection which db is queried)?
-Possibility to select, copy, do stuff with metadata panel
-Possibility to execute multiple queries once (seperated with ;?)
-Possibility to select seperator, commentmark etc from settings
-Support for different databases (mysql works. postgresql queries work but metadata doesn't)
-Auto completion (default: ctrl + space) for sql keywords and tables/fields after connected to database

UI stuff:
-Nicer looking metadata panel and UI fix (doesn't stretch to parent container)
-Scrollbars don't move correctly when resizing window
-Nice images and tooltip texts for buttons?
-Overall styles

Something else:
-Disable connection button when connection is established?
